          Role of Ayurmanthra in Immunity boosting system through Ayurveda
        </h2>
        <p  className='text-justify'>
          Ayurveda deals with negative and positive emotions. Illness is the
          result of poor health or decreased Ojas or energy resulting in
          negative emotions. These negative emotions increase negative feelings
          like hatred, anger, worry, guilt, envy, or jealousy. This means that
          reduced immunity increases negative emotions. So the solution is to
          increase positive emotions like love, affair, good concentration, calm
          mind, or happiness. To make this happen, immune system should be
          boosted. When positive emotions increase, negative emotion reduces, as
          both contradictory.
        </p>
        <p  className='text-justify'>
          The need for immune system is due to its character of hyperactivity.
          The invasion of foreign particles are always defended and defeated by
          the cells due to this hyperactivity. Food plays a role in this
          hyperactivity of the cells. The uses of easy digestible foods are to
          be preferred over red meat or similar foods. The use of yogavahi or
          healing agents like spices, herbs etc… which have the capability of
          healing the cells and tissues are also be used in foods to boost
          immunity. Apart from these, physical exercises like walking, jogging
          or taking planks, and keeping good breathing system through practice
          of pranayama shall upgrade immunity naturally.
        </p>
        <p  className='text-justify'>
